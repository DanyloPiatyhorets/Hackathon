Hospitals receive health tracking data from countless sources every day.
From professional equipment to your own personal smartwatch, everything tracks it but there is 0 consistency.
When a hospital has data coming from all sorts of sources they can't afford to ignore 80% of it due to
incompatibility.
That problem is solved, as our EPR includes a normalising algorithm that takes data from various formats
stored in any manner and returns a single standardised excel sheet with all the data sources combined.
This not only enables us to consider a wide range of data sources for tracking such as hospital equipment,
fitness trackers, and of course human data-entry.
